# Distributed-Replicated-Key-Value-Store
CS3700 project
It is a distributed, replicated key-value datastore. A key-value datastore is a very simple type of database that supports two API calls from clients: put(key, value) and get(key). The former API allows a client application to store a key-value pair in the database, while the latter API allows a client to retrieve a previously stored value by supplying its key. Real-world examples of distributed key-value datastores include memcached, Redis, DynamoDB, etc.
It also implemented a simplified version of the Raft consensus protocol
